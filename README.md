Hi, I'm a mexican student passionate about maths, systems, typing, and programming.

### Hackerrank 
- 4 star in C ranked 23028 in the world with a 450 points, but i'm planning to get 5 stars this week.
- 1 star in C++ ranked 597674 in the wo4rld with 10 points because i don't really do C++, and I'm planning to get 3 or 4 stars the next week.

I'm also planning to a 5 or 4 stars in Python, Linux Shell, Maths, Ruby, Java and finally but the very important Data Structures.

### Personal History with programming

I know C for the lnger time since was the first programming languaje i learn, the second was JavaScript since it was easy, the next programming language i learn was 
python because it was the much used, i started using python in personal projects since it was very flexible and easy to use, but i leave it because i quit dont like
the python syntax, next i learned ruby, which i'm pretty bad it, it almost the same history with C# and unfortanly Java. Although i know C for the most time, I feel better coding with JavaScript. I use neo vim as my code editor since it's a very costumizable editor.
